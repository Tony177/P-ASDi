There is a large setup violation of -3.404 ns between sis_contatori/cont_secondi/tmp_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and mem/mem_reg[1][25]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#59 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.436 ns between sis_contatori/cont_secondi/tmp_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and mem/mem_reg[2][25]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
