There is a large setup violation of -3.057 ns between sis_contatori/cont_minuti/tmp_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and mem/mem_reg[0][18]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#59 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.058 ns between sis_contatori/cont_minuti/tmp_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and mem/mem_reg[3][18]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.076 ns between sis_contatori/cont_minuti/tmp_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and mem/mem_reg[2][18]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
